# 🧬 Patterns in Patterning: Vestigial Morphogen Gradients

This project explores the intricate relationship between **vestigial morphogen gradients** during development and the resulting **adult wing patterning** in *Drosophila*. Designed for domain experts in developmental biology, the goal is to build an **interactive data visualization dashboard** that enables researchers to uncover subtle correlations and anomalies within complex morphogen datasets.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The system provides linked visualizations that allow users to:

- **Filter and explore** morphogen gradient data under various experimental conditions (temperature, oxygen, disc size, etc.).
- **Compare distributions** across multiple parameters, including gradient width (λ) and area relationships.
- **Interactively highlight, stack, and compare** individual wing discs through dynamic radar and scatter plots.
- **Investigate variation patterns** and potential thresholds influencing final wing shape outcomes.

The tool is designed for **exploratory data analysis**, focusing on **visual insight and hypothesis generation** rather than statistical modeling.  
It bridges the gap between standard visualization tools (like JMP and R’s ggplot) and the deeper interactivity needed for biological data exploration.

## 🧠 Purpose

This visualization system empowers biologists to:

- **Visually hypothesize** relationships between morphogen gradients and wing outcomes
